In a recent article by The New York Times, the application of facial recognition technology by private businesses was examined. Companies like Facewatch, operating in the UK, provided retailers with tools to identify shoplifters and problematic customers. For a monthly fee, as low as Â£250, Facewatch offered access to a shared watchlist among nearby stores, promptly alerting them when flagged individuals entered their premises. Storeowners could contribute to this watchlist by uploading photos of known shoplifters or troublesome patrons. The technology had proven highly effective in curbing theft, thereby safeguarding businesses from financial losses.

One of the notable benefits of facial recognition technology, as highlighted in the article, was its capacity to enhance security and reduce crime-related expenses for retailers. By identifying and alerting businesses about potential shoplifters or individuals with a history of problematic behavior, facial recognition allowed for more proactive security measures. This not only protected the businesses' assets but also contributed to maintaining competitive prices and staff levels. However, these advantages were accompanied by concerns, especially regarding privacy and the possibility of misidentifications. Critics argued that such technology might lead to unwarranted intrusions into individuals' personal lives and could result in innocent people being mistakenly flagged, as evidenced by a case mentioned in the article. These issues underscored the ongoing debate surrounding the ethical and legal use of facial recognition technology in various contexts.

In a report issued by the New York State Office of Information Technology Services, the use of facial recognition technology in schools was assessed, and the report indicated that the potential risks associated with its implementation may have outweighed the benefits. Assemblywoman Monica Wallace, who had sponsored the law prohibiting biometric identifying technology in schools until the report was completed, had raised concerns regarding privacy, civil rights, false positives, and cybersecurity.

The report itself acknowledged that in an educational context, the utilization of facial recognition technology carried substantial risks. It particularly highlighted the potential for higher false positive rates among various demographic groups, including people of color, non-binary and transgender individuals, women, the elderly, and children, which could implicate civil rights laws. The report recommended a cautious approach to the use of such technology in schools, with a focus on ensuring that vulnerable populations are not disproportionately affected. Subsequently, the state Education Commissioner considered the report's findings and recommendations to decide whether to authorize the purchase or utilization of biometric identifying technology in public schools. Notably, the Lockport City School District had deactivated its facial recognition program in 2020 when the technology was prohibited by law and currently had no plans to reinstate it.
