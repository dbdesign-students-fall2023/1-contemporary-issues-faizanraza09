In a report issued by the New York State Office of Information Technology Services, the use of facial recognition technology in schools was assessed, and the report indicated that the potential risks associated with its implementation may have outweighed the benefits. Assemblywoman Monica Wallace, who had sponsored the law prohibiting biometric identifying technology in schools until the report was completed, had raised concerns regarding privacy, civil rights, false positives, and cybersecurity.

The report itself acknowledged that in an educational context, the utilization of facial recognition technology carried substantial risks. It particularly highlighted the potential for higher false positive rates among various demographic groups, including people of color, non-binary and transgender individuals, women, the elderly, and children, which could implicate civil rights laws. The report recommended a cautious approach to the use of such technology in schools, with a focus on ensuring that vulnerable populations are not disproportionately affected. Subsequently, the state Education Commissioner considered the report's findings and recommendations to decide whether to authorize the purchase or utilization of biometric identifying technology in public schools. Notably, the Lockport City School District had deactivated its facial recognition program in 2020 when the technology was prohibited by law and currently had no plans to reinstate it.
